# Stocks Analysis report


## Overview 
After we have helped Steve with analyzing 12 stocks performance for 2017 and 2018 with their total trading volumes and year return values, Steve is intersted at analyzing the entire stock market instead of only 12 stocks. For our pervious solution, it works great but the algorithm is not good or efficient enough for thousands of stocks in the real market. We are rafactoring our code with better algorithm in order to handle the bigger dataset with better performance.
